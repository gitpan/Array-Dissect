This is Array::Dissect, which converts an array into an array of arrays in a 
way that can be more useful than Array::Reform when using sorted arrays.

You require perl 5.001 or later to use this library

You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
